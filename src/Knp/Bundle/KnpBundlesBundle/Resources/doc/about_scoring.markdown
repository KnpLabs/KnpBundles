## Scoring factors:

* **1** point for each followers on **GitHub**. This is an indicator of the bundle's popularity in the community.
* **5** points if your `README` is more than 300 characters long. Encourages maintainer to write a proper `README`.
* **5** points if you use **Travis CI**, since it means you have a running test suite.
* **5** more points if your **Travis CI** build status is actually ok ;)
* **5** points if you provide a **Composer** package.
* **5** points per person recommending the bundle on **KnpBundles**.
* Small boost (the actual formula is `(30 - days) / 5`) for bundles with commits in the past 30 days. Active bundles get more points, but not much to avoid spoiling *stable* bundles.
